    "# Working with PRISM data\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1 Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data is available from Oregon State University for a variety of common climate variables such as min/max temperature, precipitation, dew point etc. These datasets are extremely useful in a variety of research applications, and they can be conveniently accessed through the [PRISM website](https://prism.oregonstate.edu/), or they can be accessed programmatically through the data api using the R package [prism](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prism/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the prism R package is great, the goal of this tutorial, and associated script, is to extend the prism package to solve a common problem. PRISM data is delivered as a raster for the contiguous US (at 4Km or 800m resolution), when often only a much smaller extent is needed to answer the research question at hand. Depending on the project, storing a large number of rasters for the whole US may be unnecessary and could massively increase data storage costs. Originally developed for a research project covering the Phoenix metro area this script is designed to work with a shapefile defining the area of interest, and includes a variety of functions which will iteratively (1) download the requested data file from PRISM, (2) clip the data to the study area, and (3) save the output clipped raster, preserving all relevant metadata and file structure. The original (US extent) data files are then, optionally, deleted to save storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Bulk download data from prism.oregonstate.edu.\n",
    "2.  Crop data to a given study area using a shapefile.\n",
    "3.  Save cropped data sets, preserve file metadata and .bil format.\n",
    "4.  Delete raw data (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Downloading PRISM data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 WARNING!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repeated downloading of files from the PRISM api may result in sanctions, including blocking your IP address. Please be respectful of these resources.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "As with any R \\[[1](#ref-base_R)\\] script, we must first load the required packages. Initially we will utilize 2 packages, prism and lubridate. The prism \\[[2](#ref-prism)\\] package is the primary R package for programmatically interacting with the PRISM api. Lubridate \\[[3](#ref-lubridate)\\] is a package for working with dates, and will be used for its `years()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```` markdown\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we set the working directory (wd). This is the absolute file path in your machine in which all the files exist, and where data will be downloaded. Relative file paths will begin at the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have used the R function `getwd()` to obtain the default working directory from your R session. This is primarily used to make sharing this script easier and more convenient, but it is highly recommended that you change the var `dir.string` to an absolute file path representing your preferred file location, as this will be used extensively while downloading and managing your PRISM data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```` markdown\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Set Working Directory (wd)\n",
    "dir.string <- getwd()  # Update with directory string as needed!\n",
    "setwd(dir.string)\n",
    "getwd()  # Check wd\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will create a new folder in our wd called “Data”, and set it as the default data download directory for the PRISM api using the `prism_set_dl_dir()` function.\n",

    "### 2.3 Defining variables of interest\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have set up our directory, we next must define the date range and variables of interest. Here I have defined a date range and set of variables for this tutorial, but in the future, this will be the section of code which you will primarily be responsible for updating to suit the needs of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.1 Setting a date range\n",
    "\n",
    "At minimum, a date range is required for data to download. Depending on the data set that you are interested in, some PRISM records extend back as far as 1895, and new data is typically made available in near real time. Here we will look for data from the beginning of 2020 through 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "```` markdown\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Define date range\n",
    "min.Date <- \"2020-01-01\"\n",
    "max.Date <- \"2022-12-31\"\n",
    "# For the most up to date data available, use max.Date <- lubridate::today()\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in some instances you may only be interested in a certain months of the year. You may optionally set a range of months here. If no months are defined, the default behavior will be to download all months of the year (if applicable). In this example we will only look at data from April to July (4 to 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "```` markdown\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Optional: list of months to download for the get_prism_monthlies() function\n",
    "months <- c(4:7)  # Numeric list, not strings!\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.2 Setting temporal resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "PRISM data is available at four temporal scales, daily, monthly, annual, and 30-year normals. While you are free to experiment with the prism functions `get_prism_dailys()`, `get_prism_monthlys()`, `get_prism_annual()`, and `get_prism_normals()` the scripts included with this tutorial have already set up the functions so that you can quickly and efficiently get the data you need with a minimum number of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to consider at this point, firstly, in some instances you may want a dis-continuous data set, such as daily observations for the month of July from 1999 to 2020. Unfortunately, none of these scripts are currently able to accept a dis-continuous date range. Your choices are to either download the full continuous dataset and subset the data after it has been downloaded, break the dataset into smaller blocks of continuous dates and run multiple times, or write your own custom script for handling date breaks. Also, the way that I have written the `get_prism_monthlys()` and `get_prism_normals()` functions may sometimes result in unexpected behavior, depending on the `min.date` and `max.date` provided. In short, the function extracts the year from the date variables, and the rest of the date bounds are disregarded. Therefore, you may get more data than you expect, but the error will always be inclusive (as opposed to not downloading requested data).\n",
    "\n",
    "```` markdown\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Define temporal resolution\n",
    "# tRes must be one of \"dailys\", \"monthlys\", \"annual\", \"normals\"\n",
    "tRes <- \"monthlys\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3.3 Setting the climatic variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 11 climactic variables available through PRISM, of which seven are available through the api. These are precipitation (ppt), mean temperature (tmean), minimum temperature (tmin), maximum temperature (tmax), mean dew point temperature (tdmean), minimum vapor pressure deficit (vpdmin), and maximum vapor pressure deficit (vpdmax). Any combination of these variables may be assigned to the `prismVars` variable, and all the requested climactic data will be downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "```` markdown\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Define data variables\n",
    "# Must be one (or several) of \"ppt\", \"tmean\", \"tmin\", \"tmax\", \"tdmean\", \"vpdmin\", \"vpdmax\"\n",
    "# Use c(\"var1\", \"var2\", etc...) for multiple variables\n",
    "prismVars <- c(\"ppt\", \"tdmean\")\n",
    "# Missing variables not available through the PRISM api = \n",
    "#   \"Soltotal\", \"Solslope\", \"Solclear\", \"Soltrans\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Downloading the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the data to download, we can execute the prism functions to connect to the api and commence data downloading. But first we will run a couple of simple checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure that the `tRes` variable is set correctly we will check it against a list. If an issue is detected it will return a custom error message which will warn the user to double check their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "```` markdown\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Check if temporal resolution (tRes) is set correctly.\n",
    "# If tRes not in list\n",
    "if (tRes != \"dailys\" & tRes != \"monthlys\" & tRes != \"annual\" & tRes != \"normals\") {\n",
    "  # Print a custom error message\n",
    "  stop('tRes must be one of \"dailys\", \"monthlys\", \"annual\", or \"normals\". Please ensure your variable is set correctly.')\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to avoid potentially costly user errors an if statement is called so that only the data of interest is downloaded. This way all of the prism `get_prism_...()` functions can be prebuilt and live inside our script, enabling us to work quickly, but (hopefully) preventing us from running the wrong function and ending up with way too much data. Here I am only showing the `get_prism_monthlies()` function which we are interested in. See the full prism.R script accompanying this tutorial to see how all the functions are defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the amount of data requested this function may take from seconds to hours. It includes several convenient progress statements, and is nested inside a timing function. This small example should take about 35 seconds to complete.\n",

    "## 3 Cropping PRISM data to study area\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been working primarily with the prism package, and have succeeded in connecting to the PRISM api and efficiently downloading data in bulk. However, this could arguably have been achieved just as efficiently by simply calling the required function from the prism package. Here we will extend the useful application of the prism package by incorporating functions from the terra package \\[[4](#ref-terra)\\] to crop the data to a study area, thereby saving ourselves from the enormous data storage costs of maintaining nationwide datasets, when we are only interested in a small region.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example we will look at Maricopa County, AZ.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "While contained within the same script for convenience, the code presented in this section is independent from the code presented in <a href=\"#sec-prism\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Section 2</a>. You may continue in your R session or may restart your R session as desired.\n",

    "### 3.2 Exploring the data\n",
    "\n",
    "While we could jump straight into the automated data processing, it is generally a good idea to take a moment to explore your data prior to bulk processing. This will also afford us the opportunity to briefly explore some of the functions of terra \\[[**tera?**](#ref-tera)\\], a massively useful package for geospatial data analysis in R!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s just load in a representative data folder, and a raster file. Here I will be using a regular expression (regex) for pattern matching. Regex is largely beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it is a wildly useful programmatic tool for advanced users. I will do my best to include plain language explanations for all my regex patterns, but for those who are interested in learning more I highly recommend reading this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/regular-expressions.html) on cran.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this simple example I have shown you how to efficiently download bulk climactic data from the PRISM api using the prism R package. I also briefly introduced the terra package and showed you how to explore and map geospatial data. Then we used a simple code block to automate the bulk processing of raw data for our area of interest, saving ~80% of file storage requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully by now you feel confident in being able to apply these methods to your own study area. By updating the shapefile and modifying a few key variables you can efficiently acquire climactic data for a broad range of applications anywhere in the contiguous US. Using the R script accompanying this tutorial you can wow your supervisors and be the envy of your peers with how simply and efficiently you are able to access the data you need.\n",
